## About

This is the SoundTrack frontend, a web application developed using Typescript, Next.js and Sass. SoundTrack uses the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api">Spotify API</a> to provide users with an overview of their streaming history, including their top artists, albums and tracks over different time periods. Users can also view data for the artists, albums and tracks, including the number of streams they have accumulated and the top listeners.

## Features

- **User Streming Data:** SoundTrack enables users to connect their Spotify Account in order to monitor their listening habits. Users can explore their favorite artists, albums, and tracks through various formats displayed on their profile.

- **Artist, Album and Track Data:** All artists, albums, or tracks streamed by a SoundTrack user are available for viewing. For instance, the artist page provides information on their top albums and tracks. Additionally, you can view the top listeners for any artist, track, or album.

- **Settings:** Within the settings pages, users have the ability to modify their profile image and banner image. They can also customize profile options, such as the timeframe and data format, which changes the default view of the users profile. Furthermore, users have the option to set their profiles as private, thus preventing others from viewing them.
